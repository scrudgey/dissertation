\chapter{Summary}

summary and conclusions

RS indistinguishable at z=1 to cluster selection effects
weak tho. diff. selection, not diff. cluster properties

``halo bias" not a thing at z=1

RS stellar ages zf>3
RS age scatter

tQ seems to evolve as the dynamical time

future work:

larger, uniform sample from z=0 to 1.6 to interpret
changes in cluster population

unpacking the time-averaged tq

simulations (see adam comments)
