environmental mechanism
  Until now, most current semi-analytic models of galaxy formation have adopted a crude modelling of the ram-pressure stripping of the hot-gaseous haloes of satellite galaxies. In particular, they typ- ically assume complete and instantaneous stripping of the hot-gas halo when the galaxy first falls in, without regard for the galaxyâ€™s mass, orbit or structural properties. This is at odds with results of hydrodynamic simulations, and also with recent X-ray observations of galaxies in massive clusters.

environmental and mass quenching NOT independent!
    Although treated as separate processes, AGN quenching and environmental quenching are clearly connected in the model. Hot gas masses are larger in more massive haloes, leading to enhanced black hole accretion and AGN feedback in denser environments. In addition, such environments promote black hole growth by enhancing both mergers with smaller black holes and merger-stimulated accretion of cold gas. At the same time, larger halo and hot gas masses boost environmental quenching through tidal and ram-pressure stripping. As a result, one may expect that quenched central galaxies will typically have more massive haloes and more massive hot gas atmospheres than blue centrals of sim- ilar stellar mass, and that this will cause a larger fraction of their satellites to be quenched. Wang & White (2012) showed that this effect is indeed present in the Guo et al. (2011) model and compared its strength to the effects they found in SDSS data, demonstrating that all the observed trends with satellite and primary stellar mass are reproduced qualitatively by the model but that its satellites are systematically too red.

the picture is clearly complicated.
