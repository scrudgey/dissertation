Q:

spectral clustering algorithm?

why not halo infall rates instead of mass infall rates?

time evolution of tQ is not included in model, but tQ does evolve
how does averaging over the past affect measured tQ?
A: it doesn't affect those studies which only look at the SF population and so the main conclusions are safe (check)

environment-mass interplay:
denser environments container larger hot gas masses and therefore enhance AGN feedback and promote BH mergers, but they also enhance RPS and tidal stripping.

could the "green valley" that i see at high z be the result of photometric uncertainty?
it would explain why

derive dynamical time

understand why delayed-then-rapid arguments
(see snippets)

understand SAM and hydro better

understand in detail the mechanism of RPS: what does it depend on?
  ICM density gradient? how does this change with z?
tidal disruption?


citation for disk stripping being seen?


the essential thing is that the *evolution* is dynamical.
if it's a constant (related to outflows?) + dynamical delay, then we would see this same behavior.
gas depletion time is roughly constant, and evolves very slowly with redshift
outflow time is short
