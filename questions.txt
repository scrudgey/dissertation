Q:

time evolution of tQ is not included in model, but tQ does evolve
how does averaging over the past affect measured tQ?

discuss in summary:
dynamical evolution is consistent with most massive galaxies,
  but this is also where mass quenching should be strongest.
can you really justify ram pressure stripping as the primary mechanism?
  font 2008: gradual RPS is good!

understand in detail the mechanism of RPS: what does it depend on?
  ICM density gradient? how does this change with z?
