Q:

time evolution of tQ is not included in model, but tQ does evolve
how does averaging over the past affect measured tQ?
derive dynamical time
understand why delayed-then-rapid arguments


discuss in summary:
dynamical evolution is consistent with most massive galaxies, but this is also where mass quenching should be strongest.
can you really justify ram pressure stripping as the primary mechanism?
don't forget about tidal stripping
  font 2008: gradual RPS is good!
  henriquez: RPS is essential (but they only apply to cluster halos)

understand in detail the mechanism of RPS: what does it depend on?
  ICM density gradient? how does this change with z?
tidal disruption?

the essential thing is that the *evolution* is dynamical.
if it's a constant (related to outflows?) + dynamical delay, then we would see this same behavior.
gas depletion time is roughly constant, and evolves very slowly with redshift
outflow time is
